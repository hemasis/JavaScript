# JavaScript Concepts Repository

This repository contains various JavaScript code examples, covering key concepts and foundational topics. It is primarily aimed at helping you quickly revise JavaScript concepts and understand different coding techniques.
`` I will keep on adding codes from basics to advanced everyday.``

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to provide a **collection of JavaScript code** organized by topics. It serves as a **revision guide** for learners and developers looking to quickly refresh their knowledge of JavaScript programming. Each code file is accompanied by brief explanations of the concepts, making it easy to follow and understand.

## Topics Covered

This repository will include code for a wide range of JavaScript topics, including:

- **Variables and Data Types**
- **Control Flow (Conditionals & Loops)**
- **Functions and Scope**
- **Arrays and Objects**
- **DOM Manipulation**
- **Event Handling**
- **ES6 Features (Arrow Functions, Template Literals, etc.)**
- **Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, async/await)**

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/JavaScript.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the specific folder for the concept you want to review, for example, `01_Basics`.

3. Open the `.js` files in any text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) to view the code.

4. Each code file includes a brief explanation at the top or throughout the code to help you understand the logic and syntax used.

5. Modify or run the code in your local development environment to practice and experiment with the concepts.

## Folder Structure

- **01_Basics**: Basic JavaScript concepts (variables, data types, operators).
- **02_Basics**: More intermediate topics like arrays, objects, and functions.
- **README.md**: This file.

## Example of Code in `01_Basics/01_Variables.js`

```javascript
// Example: Declare variables and log to the console

let name = "John";  // String type
const age = 25;     // Number type
let isStudent = true; // Boolean type

console.log(name); // Output: John
console.log(age);  // Output: 25
console.log(isStudent); // Output: true
```

### Explanation:

- **Variables** are declared using `let`, `const`, or `var` in JavaScript.
- `let` allows reassignment, while `const` makes the variable constant.
- Basic data types include `string`, `number`, and `boolean`.
